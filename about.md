I'm an urban designer turned open web developer—which isn't as odd as it sounds. I use technology to build tools and visuals so that information—be it urban systems, code, or government—is more accessible.

I champion open knowledge, documentation, and kindness. I also believe [open source is a privilege](/blog/osos-talk.html).

<span class="meta">A Little Update</span>

**I've recently left GitHub and am taking a little break from work and open source for a couple of months and then getting back into the swing of things at the new year.**

## Work History

Most recently I was a desktop application Node.js engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com) where I started the [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) team. During my 3+ years at GitHub I also worked on [Atom](http://atom.io), [github.com](https://github.com), and front-end design projects on supporting sites such as [government.github.com](http://government.github.com). In 2013 I started the [Patchwork](http://patchwork.github.com) community event to teach Git and GitHub to beginners.

<small class="meta">Neat-o</small><br>
<small class="sans-serif grey">My Git and GitHub tutorial app, [Git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron), has over 12,000 completions. My [repository](http://jlord.github.io/jlord/patchwork) for it is the [4th most contributed to project on GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com), surrounded by organizations like npm, Docker and Facebook.</small>

My work as a full-time developer began in 2012 when, during my fellowship year with [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org), I built open source tools for city government.

<small class="meta">Neat-o</small><br>
<small class="sans-serif grey">After the fellowship, my main project for visualizing spreadsheet data on websites would later become [Sheetsee.js](http://jlord.us/sheetsee.js) through a News Sprint Grant from <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Knight-Mozilla's</span> [OpenNews](https://www.opennews.org).</small>

<!-- <span class="meta">Tools: Git, GitHub, JS, HTML, CSS, Shapefiles, QGIS, Mapbox, D3, Wordpress, Illustrator, Photoshop, Heroku</span> -->

I have a background in design thanks to a degree (and many sleepless nights) in architecture from [Georgia Tech](http://www.arch.gatech.edu). After graduation I worked at <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Rutledge-Alcock</span> Architects before joining the [City of Boston's Urban Design Technology Group](http://www.bostonplans.org). For three years at the City I worked on design reviews, crafted neighborhood plans, and created digital models, maps and other visual elements. Here are [some examples](http://jlord.us/arch-urban-design.html).

<small class="meta">Neat-o</small><br>
<small class="sans-serif grey">During this period I became LEED BD+C (Building Design and Construction) accredited and was a part of the first groups to test for and earn the LEED ND (Neighborhood Development) accreditation (they have since lapsed, of course, as I've been in web development).</small>

Before all of this, I was a [baby](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKjt6hPjv2f/?taken-by=jlord) and teenager in the [heart of Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Robins,_Georgia). I'm currently in Portland, Oregon (and missing the east coast). Should we [work together](mailto: jess.lord@gmail.com)?!

## About the Site

I built a [static site generator](http://www.github.com/jlord/balrog) and built [this site](http://www.github.com/jlord/jlord.github.io). It took forever. Typefaces are [Lora](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lora), [Source Sans Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Source Code Pro](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) from Google Web Fonts.
