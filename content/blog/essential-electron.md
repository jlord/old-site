I challenged myself to test out an idea for a informational site on a technical thing, Electron, that tried to be as concise and plainly worded as I could get it. So here's [Essential Electron](jlord.us/essential-electron), something I'll keep tweaking!

Technical documentation can be long, jargon-heavy and hard to know where to begin with. I think having detailed documentation is good in general, I felt there was a place for something simpler that answered fundamental questions about a project (in my case, Electron) in as few sentences as I could get it and replacing jargon with, well, whatever the opposite is, and defining potential new terms.

I set out last week to try and see what this idea might look like, which resulted in [Essential Electron](jlord.us/essential-electron). It was an interesting challenge for all of the reasons I just listed above. I had to think about everything I wrote: is this _essential_, is this a new word or concept worth learning or is it jargon that can be expanded? I tried to use these guidelines:

- Main section should be 2-3 sentences.
- New concepts/words defined.
- Jargon replaced with expanded phrasing.
- Graphic added when applicable.
- Links for more information provided in each section.

I wanted to take people through the flow of learning what Electron is, what development is like and how to get started, while remaining high-level. Someone should be able to go through each of the sections and only read the large text and still get a good sense of what Electron is. If a word or concept is new they can check the definitions. If a particular section is of interest they can use the resources to get more information.

I pulled and tweaked some graphics from a previous workshop I'd done to help illustrate this points. I'm pretty happy with the experiment though I have some more ideas and will keep refining this. Hope it turns out useful to some!
