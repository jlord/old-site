I'm an urban designer turned open web developer—which isn't as odd as it sounds.

I'm the lead for the Developer Tools team at [Glitch](https://glitch.com). Before that I worked on the API at [Splice](https://splice.com) and before that a bunch of things at [GitHub](https://github.com), last was starting the [Electron](https://electronjs.org) team. The year that changed everything was being a [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org) fellow in 2012.

I did the fellowship after working at the City of Boston's Urban Design Technology group and an architecture firm. Before that I was in college, Georgia Tech, graduating with an architecture degree. Before all that I was an awkward teen in Middle Georgia and a baby!

I champion open knowledge, documentation, and kindness. Also: [open source is a privilege](/blog/osos-talk.html). Selected side projects are on my [work](/work.html) page.

Also, also! I saw [all the paintings by Vermeer](http://jlord.dev/vermeer/index.html)!

### About the Site

I built a [static site generator](http://www.github.com/jlord/balrog) and built [this site](http://www.github.com/jlord/jlord.github.io). It took forever. Typefaces are [Lora](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lora), [Source Sans Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Source Code Pro](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) from Google Web Fonts.
