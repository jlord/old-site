<p>I recently re-did <a title="Mikeal Rogers" href="http://twitter.com/mikeal" target="_blank">Mikeal Rogers</a> website, <a title="Future Aloof, Mikeal Rogers" href="http://www.futurealoof.com" target="_blank">Future Aloof</a>. As the person who came up with the designs, I have only myself to blame for the crazy mess that is the horizontal reading website I&#8217;d envisioned. Let&#8217;s talk about it. Below is the structure of the important components for Future Aloof:<br><!--more--></p>

<h3 id="css-multi-column-video-bar">CSS Multi-Column, Video Bar</h3>
<p>I needed the text to expand right in columns in a predetermined area of the page subject to change depending on if the video bar is toggled on and off. Video bar should be the width of the site and not end awkwardly in the middle. The path I took to making this work is what I discuss below, ignoring a lot of the overflow, white-space and other tribulations. The site also does a few other things like respond to your screen and at 1024px and under the video bar is eliminated and &#8216;video&#8217; in the menu no longer toggles the bar but becomes a link to a video page. But those weren&#8217;t as finicky as these other bits.</p>
<h4 id="issue-force-columns-to-expand-right">Issue: Force Columns to Expand Right</h4>
<p>Multi-column, and it seems the web in general, wants to expand down &#8211; not right. The only way I found to constrain the multi-column element <code>#entries</code> where I wanted it and force it to expand right was to wrap it in a container <code>#entryWrapper</code> with padding . There is a max-height option, which I may or may not have tried, it&#8217;s a haze, but in the end I chose to keep all constraining forces together in <code>#entryWrapper</code>.</p>
<p>On <code>#entries</code> I&#8217;m using <code>column-width: 300px;</code> so that it generates as many columns as it needs (rather than prescribing a number of columns with <code>column-count: x;</code>). Note, it uses this as a min-width suggestion and in my case generated columns that are 387px wide. I&#8217;m happy to say that the column-gap will remain true to you.</p>
<h4 id="issue-no-self-awareness">Issue: No Self Awareness</h4>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got the columns constrained to where we want them on the page and they&#8217;re expanding right, we must solve the issue that it <code>#entries</code> has no idea how many columns it&#8217;s generated and how wide that&#8217;s made it or its parent <code>#entryWrapper</code>. This means other children like <code>#videoWrapper</code> won&#8217;t fill to match this unknown width.</p>
<p>So I set empty span &#8220;markers&#8221; at the start <code>#theStart</code> and end <code>#theEnd</code> of the text in <code>#entries</code>. I then used jquery to find the distance between the two, adjusting for negative numbers if the page has been scrolled right and the remaining column width to the right of <code>#theEnd</code>.</p>
<pre>var start = Math.abs($('#theStart').offset().left)
var end = ($('#theEnd').offset().left) + 400
var pageWidth = start + end</pre>

<p>I use this the give <code>#videoWrapper</code> a width on load and when the video bar is toggled on and off (because when the text has more or less vertical space, it takes up more or less horizontal space).</p>
<p>Also, forget having any control over things like particular columns or every other column or nth column&#8230;</p>
<h4 id="issue-firefox">Issue: Firefox</h4>
<p>While Firefox supports the multi-column in general, it doesn&#8217;t seem to support <code>column-break-before</code> or <code>column-break-after</code>, which is a shame, because in webkit that&#8217;s how you can tell it to avoid breaking in the middle of lists or block quotes and to always break for new posts.</p>
<p>Those damn scrollbars. In webkit I can hide the scrollbar <code>::-webkit-scrollbar {height: 0px; width: 0px;}</code> and keep things looking the way I want while still having scrolling available through trackpad, mice, arrow keys or on-screen arrow clicks. Since the scrolling element is behind the right and left column navigation elements, in Firefox the scrollbar was awkwardly cut off on each end and made the center portion of the page however many pixels taller than the two right and left elements. Not wanting to use major plugins for dealing with scroll bars I sacrificed some of the single-frame experience of the page and used jquery to check for Firefox and then change the CSS structure so that the entire page scrolled and a more tolerable-full-screen-width scrollbar is used.</p>
<h3 id="tell-me-there-is-a-better-way">Tell Me There is a Better Way</h3>
<p>Things seems fairly straightforward now, but it was quite a process. I did a lot of internet-researching, friend&#8217;s brains picking and general starting over and trying again before I came to these solutions. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be many horizontal reading-based (not just photography portfolios) websites out there &#8211; perhaps there is a reason. I&#8217;ll also mention that I was very much trying to keep the site as light and simple as I could. I didn&#8217;t want to bulk up on plugins or write mega js to parse text and generate columns. I like it being mostly CSS and 69 lines of jquery (half of which is unrelated to columns and scrolling right but handles toggling of the video bar and menu navigation) But, alas, there now exists one! A horizontal reading site! Push the web right!</p>
<p>But seriously, share experiences and insights, please.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just updated <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js">Sheetsee.js</a> with new features and all new docs. I&#39;ve been waiting to ship this, it feels like, for far too long. I&#8217;m hoping now Sheetsee is at a solid enough place that I can focus spare time on making more <a href="http://www.jlord.us/fork-n-go">fork-n-go</a> examples.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll get straight to the most exciting point: the new <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao5u1U6KYND7dGN5QngweVJUWE16bTRob0d2a3dCbnc&amp;usp=drive_web&amp;pli=1#gid=0">sample data</a> for the demos is of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessllord/sets/72157640471928365/">flattened penny collection</a>. Below are the other things.</p>
<h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3>
<p>Yay!</p>
<h4 id="tables-pagination-multi-table-sorting-and-filtering">Tables: Pagination, Multi Table Sorting and Filtering</h4>
<p>Tables can now be paginated so that you don&#8217;t have to display your entire spreadsheet of data in one go. Unless you want to.</p>
<p>Tables now supports having multiple tables with sorting and filtering. So long as you keep your table IDs straight, you&#8217;re golden.</p>
See: <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js/demos/demo-table.html">table demo</a>
<h4 id="maps-polygons-and-lines">Maps: Polygons and Lines</h4>
<p>Maps now support polygons and lines. So long as you have the correct coordinate structure in your cells, Sheetsee will add them to the geoJSON it creates for your maps. More details for coordinates of lines and polygons in geoJSON are <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson.html">here</a>, but briefly:</p>
<p>A linestring:</p>
<pre><code>[-122.41722106933594, 37.7663045891584], [-122.40477561950684, 37.77695634643178]</code></pre>
<p>A polygon:</p>
<pre><code>[-122.41790771484375, 37.740381166384914], [-122.41790771484375, 37.74520008134973], [-122.40966796874999, 37.74520008134973],[-122.40966796874999, 37.740381166384914], [-122.41790771484375, 37.740381166384914]</code></pre>
<p>A Multipolygon:</p>
<pre><code>[[-122.431640625, 37.79106586542567], [-122.431640625, 37.797441398913286], [-122.42666244506835, 37.797441398913286],[-122.42666244506835, 37.79106586542567], [-122.431640625, 37.79106586542567]],
[[-122.43352890014648, 37.78197638783258], [-122.43352890014648, 37.789031004883654], [-122.42443084716797, 37.789031004883654], [-122.42443084716797, 37.78197638783258], [-122.43352890014648, 37.78197638783258]]</code></pre>
<p>See: <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js/demos/demo-map.html">map demo</a>.</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>I redid the documentation and website for Sheetsee. Instead of one <em>gigantic</em> readme file/website, all of the different elements are given their own file/page. Now you can find docs, demos, tips and such all filed away nicely here in the <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js">repository</a> and on the <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js">website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>The other big thing that has happened to Sheetsee is that I&#39;ve taken each component (core, maps, tables and charts) and made them into their own Node.js module. This makes for smaller, more manageable code files and it makes it so that users can build their own version of Sheetsee with just the elements they want to use. For instance, if you&#39;re only making maps, just build a Sheetsee with the map component.</p>
<p>All builds come with the <code>sheetsee-core</code> module which contains all of the data organizing functions.</p>
<p>The module <code>sheetsee</code> is a command line module that builds your custom sheetsee for you.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not interested in Node modules or building anything, that&#39;s ok, too. I&#39;ll always keep a full build (with all the components) here in <a href="https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js/tree/master/js">the sheetsee.js repository</a> (which from here on out exists to be the consolidated documentation and source of a full build).</p>
<p>If you need to file an issue for a bug or feature, try and file it on the repository with the component it relates to (they each have their own repository now):</p>
